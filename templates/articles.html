  <h1>Articles</h1>
  <p>The Articles tab is similar to a forum style page. It focuses on displaying a list of Q/A answered by the community. The purpose is to
  provide users with a platform to communicate between the community on particular routes and rides. This can be used to help riders read reviews on
  specific trails to evaluate things such as but not limited to: difficulty, duration, and leisure.</p>
